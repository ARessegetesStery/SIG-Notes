\section{Preliminaries}

\textstart
To get familiar with the context, first present the definition of the various boundary conditions:

\begin{definition}
    Given an (ordinary/partial) differential equation with domain $\Omega$,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{Dirichlet boundary condition} fixes the value of solution on the boundary of domain. 
        \item A \textbf{Neumann boundary condition} fixes the derivative (normal) applied at the boundary of the domain.
        \item A \textbf{Robin boundary condition} is a weighed combination of the previous two. Explicitly, for given \emph{functions} $a, b, g$ defined on $\partial \Omega$ the associated Robin boundary condition is (for target function $f$)
        \[
            a\ f + b\ \partial_n f = g \qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega$}
        \]
        where $\partial_n(\cdot)$ denotes the normal derivative.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\textstart
The followings are a collection some purely Mathematical definitions for formal description of objects introduced. They are not necessarily essential for understanding the objects, and serves as a reminder merely. You are welcome (and suggested) to skip this part, and refer back to these definitions when encountering anything unfamiliar.

\begin{definition}[$\sigma$-algebra]
    Given a set $X$ with $\P(X)$ its power set, a subset $\Sigma \subseteq P(X)$ is a \textbf{$\sigma$-algebra} if it satisfies
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
        \item $X \in \Sigma$.
        \item $\Sigma$ is closed under complement.
        \item $\Sigma$ is closed under countable unions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{remark}
    By applying De Morgan's Law directly, $\sigma$-algebras are also closed under countable intersections.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Borel (Measurable) Space]
    A \textbf{Borel space}, (or \textbf{measurable space}), is a tuple $(X, \mathcal{F})$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{remark}
    This needs to be distinguished from the \emph{measure space}: no measure is required for a measurable space. The ``measurable'' here refers to the sets in $\mathcal{F}$ are ``measured'', or considered, in $\P(X)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Stochastic Process]
    A \textbf{stochastic process} on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \Pr)$ with a measurable space $(S, \Sigma)$ and index set $T$ (often time, subset of $\R$) is a collection of $S$-valued random variables with evaluations $\{ X(t) \mid t \in T \}$.
\end{definition}

\section{Solving Dirichlet Problems by ``Walk On Spheres'' \cite{WalkOnSphere}}

Due to the complexity of algebraic manipulation/approximation, some advanced results will be used as black box, and will be marked with {\color{darkpurple} purple}. Please refer to the original paper for details. Also, results with detailed proofs in the original paper will be reasoned with the ``intuitions''; and important results presented without proof in the paper will be explained in detail. 

\begin{definition}[Harmonic Function]
    A twice continuously differentiable $\R$-valued function $f: U \to \R$ is \textbf{harmonic} if $\nabla^2 f \equiv 0$ on $U$.
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{definition}[Dirichlet Problem]
    Given a domain (for simplicity assume that this is simply-connected) $D$ with boundary $\partial D$, a \textbf{Dirichlet problem} associated to a function $f$ continuously defined on $\partial D$ is to find the function $u$ defined on $R$ s.t. $u$ and $f$ coincide on $\partial D$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Discretization of Brownian Motion}

\begin{definition}[Brownian Motion]
    A \textbf{$\R^d$-valued Brownian motion} starting at $x \in \R^d$ is a stochastic process $\{ B(t) \mid t \in T := \R_{\geq 0} \}$ satisfying the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
        \item \emph{Anchor:} $B(0) = x$.
        \item \emph{Independent incrementals:} for any increasing sequence $(t_n)_{n \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$ on $T$, $\{ B(t_{i+1}) - B(t_i) \mid i \in \Z_{\geq 0} \}$ are independent random variables.
        \item \emph{Normality in each step:} For all $t \geq 0, h > 0$, the incremental $B(t + h) - B(t)$ follows a normal distribution $N(0, h)$.
        \item \emph{Continuity:} The function $t \mapsto B(t)$ is almost surely (i.e., has probability 1 of being) continuous.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{remark}
    Property 4) in the definition actually loosens the definition; but the discontinuity does not interfere with any numerical treatment, as it happens with probability 0.
\end{remark}
\nogap
\begin{notation}
For simplicity, the evaluation of Brownian motion $B$ will be denoted as $X(t, \omega)$ with $\omega \in \R$ a random variable specifying the exact value of $B(t)$. That is, for $X(t, \omega) \in \R^N$. 
\end{notation}

\textstart
In a domain $D$, given an arbitrary Brownian motion $B$, it can be discretized into an infinite sequence of points (associated to the corresponding time index $t$), where the distribution (w.r.t. $t$) is preserved:

\begin{definition}[Maximum Sphere]
    Let $D$ be an arbitrary domain, and $x \in D$ be an arbitrary point. Then the \textbf{maximum sphere} centered at $x$ in $D$, denoted $\bm{K}_D(x)$, is the sphere
    \[
        S(x, \inf_{x_0 \in \partial D} \{ \norm{x - x_0} \})
    \]
    Its boundary (surface of the sphere) is denoted as $\overline{\bm{K}}_D(x)$.
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{definition}[Successive Intersections]
    Given a Brownian motion $B$ with arbitrary ambient domain $D$, its \textbf{successive intersections} w.r.t. $D$ is a (possibly, and often, infinite) sequence $P_n(B(0), \bm{K}_D(P_{n-1}), \omega)$ defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $P_0(B(0), -, \omega) := B(0)$.
        \item $P_{n}(B(0), \overline{\bm{K}}(P_{n-1}), \omega)$ is the point where $X(t, \omega)$ for the first time intersects with $\overline{\bm{K}}_D(P_{n-1})$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\textstart
Notice that by the randomness defined in the Brownian motion, the distribution of $P_n$ on $\overline{\bm{K}}_D(P_{n-1})$ is uniform; this is also a Markov chain since the local direction $P_n - P_{n-1}$ is uniformly random, and is independent over $n$ (by requirement 2) in the definition of Brownian motion). Therefore this can be ``perfectly simulated'' with the following process:

\begin{definition}[Spherical Process]
    Given a domain $D$ with boundary $\partial D$ and an arbitrary point $x \in D$, the \textbf{spherical process} defines a sequence of points $P_n(x, \phi)$ where $\phi$ is the random variable, as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $P_0(x, \phi) := x$.
        \item For all $i \in \Z_{\geq 1}$, designate $P_i$ uniformly randomly from $\overline{\bm{K}}_D (P_{i-1})$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

It is then clear, that given a Brownian motion with random variable $\omega = \omega_0$ it corresponds uniquely to a spherical process with random variable $\phi = \phi(\omega_0)$; and vice versa. This allows application of the results proved for Brownian motion to obtain the solution of the Dirichlet problem; and use Monte Carlo methods on the spherical process for numerical quadrature.

\subsection{Obtaining Solution from Spherical Process}

\textstart
The solution of the Dirichlet problem associated to function $f$ is computed directly using the following result. A complete context of the result can be found in \cite{Kakutani1944}. Notice that the ``measure'' in the integration involves the aforementioned Brownian motion. \hyperlink{https://willierushrush.github.io/posts/2021/08/dirichlet-problem}{This blog} provides a good excursion into the topic. 

\begin{proposition}[Kakutani's Principle]
    Given a Dirichlet problem defined on a domain $D$ with boundary values $f(\zeta)$ for $\zeta \in \partial D$, for any $x_0 \in D$, the solution $u$ of the Dirichlet problem evaluates to
    \[
        u(x_0) = \int_{\partial D} \Pr(x_0, \zeta, D) f(\zeta) \d \zeta \qquad \forall x_0 \in D
    \]
    where $\Pr(x_0, \zeta, D)$ is the probability density function of a Brownian motion starting at $x_0$ intersects for the first time with $\partial D$ at $\zeta$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    {\color{red} TODO: check math stackexchange.}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The probability function $\Pr(x_0, \zeta, D) \d \zeta =: \d \omega$ defines a measure, and is called the \underline{harmonic measure}.
\end{remark}

\textstart
Numerically, the quadrature can be approximated via applying Monte Carlo analysis on the spherical process.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}

\textstart
First we need to show that the spherical process indeed (almost always, i.e. with probability 1) converges.

\begin{proposition}[{\color{darkpurple} \cite{WalkOnSphere} Theorem 3.6}]
    The sequence $(P_i(x_0 [:= B(0)], -, D))_{i \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$ obtained by the spherical process converges, with probability 1, to a point on $\partial D$, and coincides with the first intersection between $B(t)$ and $\partial D$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Intuition]
    By the analogy between the spherical process and random walk, $B(t)$ intersects $\partial D$ at some finite time $t_0$ for the first time with probability 1. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider the time sequence $T_i$ taking values in $\R$ specifying the time of Brownian motion corresponding to the spherical process fixed by sequence $(P_i)_{i \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$ coming across the point $P_i$. It is strictly increasing, and bounded above by $t_0$, which implies that it has a limit, denoted $\bar{t_0}$. Therefore \emph{$(P_i)_{i \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$ converges}.
        \item Consider $\bar{P} = B(\bar{t_0})$ which by definition of $t_0$ must be either in interior of $D$ or on $\partial D$. If $\bar{P}$ is in the interior, then $\bar{K}(\bar{P})$ has nonzero diameter. Specifically, choosing $\varepsilon$ small enough gives, for any $n$ large enough s.t. $P_n \to \bar{P}$, $\norm{P_n - P_{n+1}} > \varepsilon$ with probability 1, where $P_{n+1}$ is the resulting point of iterating again using the spherical process. Therefore \emph{$(P_i)_{i \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$ converges to the interior of $D$}.
        \item The spherical process cannot produce points outside $D$; and by the minimality of $t_0$ this gives the coincidence between $\lim_{n \to \infty} P_n$ and $B(t_0)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\textstart
Now we show the order of convergence:

\begin{theorem}[{\color{darkpurple} \cite{WalkOnSphere} Chapter 6}]
    Let $N$ be the dimension s.t. the problem domain $\Omega \subseteq \R^N$. Then the steps required for convergence of the method is linear in $N$ if $D$ is convex. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
    First we show this for a simplified scenario. Consider the case where $\partial D$ is a hyperplane in $\R^N$, i.e. a plane identifiable with $\R^{N - 1}$. Define the coordinate system for $\R^N$ as $(y, \cdots)$ s.t. for $P_i = (y_i, \cdots)$, the distance from $P_i$ to $\partial D$ is $y_i$. Now for a starting point of the spherical process $P_0 = (y_0, \cdots)$ we consider the sequence $(y_i)_{i \in \Z_{\geq 0}}$:

    \begin{paraindent}
        \begin{lemma}[{\color{darkpurple} \cite{WalkOnSphere} Theorem 6.1, 6.2}]
            Under the above setup, we have the asymptotic result for $N \to \infty$
            \[
                \E\left( \left. \log \frac{y_{i+1}}{y_i} \right| N \right) \sim -\frac{1}{2N}
            \]
        \end{lemma}

        \begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
            First notice that the $y_{i}$s are related via $\frac{y_{i+1}}{y_i} = 1 - \cos \theta_{i+1}$, where $\theta_{i+1}$ is the angle formed by the normal of $\partial D$ and $(P_{i+1} - P_i)$. Integrating the probability on the sphere gives
            \[
                \E\left( \left. \log \frac{y_{i+1}}{y_i} \right| N \right) = \frac{\int_{0}^{\pi} \log (1 - \cos \theta) \sin^{N-2} \theta \d \theta}{\int_0^{\pi} \sin^{N-2} \theta \d \theta}
            \]
            Manipulating the expression above gives the asymptotic. Refer to the original paper for details.
        \end{proof}
    \end{paraindent}

    Then the expected steps of convergence is 
    \[
        \frac{1}{ \abs{\left( \left. \log \frac{y_{i+1}}{y_i} \right| N \right)}} \sim N = O(N) 
    \]
    Now we seek to extend this to general convex sets. For each $P_i$ consider the point $\zeta_i \in \partial D$ where the minimum distance $\text{radius}(P_i)$ is realized. Let $\partial D_i$ be the tangent plane of $\partial D$ at $\zeta_i$, with the corresponding distance coordinate $y_{(\cdot)}^{(i)}$. Notice that $y_{i+1}^{(i)} \geq y_{i+1}^{(i+1)}$ by minimality. Therefore $y_{(\cdot)}^{(0)}$, which converges to 0 in $O(N)$ steps, gives an upper bound for number of steps required for convergence. This implies the actual convergence order is also $O(N)$. 
\end{proof}
